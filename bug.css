The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a nested element might not produce the expected result if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue is using units inconsistently within a `calc()` expression (e.g., mixing `px` and `em`).  Also, forgetting to escape special characters within strings used with `attr()` function can lead to unexpected results.
